# Collaborative Repository for GWU and Uzilina
Welcome to the collaborative repository for George Washington University (GWU) and Uzilina. This repository serves as a central hub for joint projects, research, and development efforts between our institutions.  Here, you will find shared resources, code, documentation, and updates on ongoing projects. 

The SUMO version used is 1.2.0. 

## Network
This folder has all files needed for running the simulation:
1) baseline_simulation.py : the simulation starts and some information will be extracted by running this python file
2) route_creator.py creates the routing files based on extracted data and will incorporate the calibration parameters distribution soon
3) Other typical SUMO network files

## DRL_Control 
It contains all necessary elements to control the traffic signals using a Deep Reinforcement Learning model

## Models
Model 17 is the most recent best performant model

Some edits for the pedestrian routes will be added.
